MoinMoin - sourcecode header template

Please use this template when starting a new python source file.

It is important that all sourcecode files have the same header structure,
are correctly copyrighted and licensed and have a reasonable docstring
explaining what the module / package does.

Of course you'll have to edit/fix the Copyright line and also the docstring
needs to be replaced with something making sense, but keep the structure.
