class AccessControlList(AutoNe):
    """
    Access Control List - controls who may do what.

    Syntax of an ACL string:

        [+|-]User[,User,...]:[right[,right,...]] [[+|-]SomeGroup:...] ...
        ... [[+|-]Known:...] [[+|-]All:...]

        "User" is a user name and triggers only if the user matches.
        Any name can be used in acl lines, including names with spaces
        using exotic languages.

        "SomeGroup" is a group name. The group defines its members somehow,
        e.g. on a wiki page of this name as first level list with the group
        members' names.

        "Known" is a special group containing all valid / known users.

        "All" is a special group containing all users (Known and Anonymous users).

        "right" may be an arbitrary word like read, write or admin.
        Only valid words are accepted, others are ignored (see valid param).
        It is allowed to specify no rights, which means that no rights are given.

    How ACL is processed

        When some user is trying to access some ACL-protected resource,
        the ACLs will be processed in the order they are found. The first
        matching ACL will tell if the user has access to that resource
        or not.

        For example, the following ACL tells that SomeUser is able to
        read and write the resources protected by that ACL, while any
        member of SomeGroup (besides SomeUser, if part of that group)
        may also admin that, and every other user is able to read it.

            SomeUser:read,write SomeGroup:read,write,admin All:read

        In this example, SomeUser can read and write but can not admin
        items. Rights that are NOT specified on the right list are
        automatically set to NO.

    Using Prefixes

        To make the system more flexible, there are also two modifiers:
        the prefixes "+" and "-".

            +SomeUser:read -OtherUser:write

        The acl line above will grant SomeUser read right, and OtherUser
        write right, but will NOT block automatically all other rights
        for these users. For example, if SomeUser asks to write, the
        above acl line does not define if he can or can not write. He
        will be able to write if the acls checked before or afterwards
        allow this (see configuration options).

        Using prefixes, this acl line:

            SomeUser:read,write SomeGroup:read,write,admin All:read

        Can be written as:

            -SomeUser:admin SomeGroup:read,write,admin All:read

        Or even:

            +All:read -SomeUser:admin SomeGroup:read,write,admin

        Note that you probably would not want to use the second and
        third examples in ACL entries of some item. They are very
        useful in the wiki configuration though.
