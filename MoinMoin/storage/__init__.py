    MoinMoin - Backends - Storage API Definition.

    The storage API consists of the classes defined in this module. That is:
    Backend, Item, Revision, NewRevision and StoredRevision.

    A concrete backend implements the abstract methods defined by the API,
    but also uses concrete methods that have already been defined in this
    module.
    A backend is a collection of items. Examples for backends include SQL,
    mercurial or filesystem. All of those are means to store data.

    Items are the units you store within those backends. You can store content
    of arbitrary type in an item, e.g. text, images or even films.

    An item itself has revisions and metadata. For instance, you can use that
    to show a diff between two `versions` of a page, where the page "Foo" is
    represented by an item and the two versions are represented by two
    revisions of that item.

    Metadata is data that describes other data. An item has metadata. Each
    revision has metadata as well. E.g. "Which user created this revision?"
    would be something stored in the metadata of a revision, while "Who created
    this page in the first place?" would be answered by looking at the metadata
    of the first revision. Thus, an item basically is a collection of revisions
    which contain the content for the item. The last revision represents the most
    recent contents. A stored item can have metadata or revisions, or both.

    For normal operation, revision data and metadata are immutable as soon as the
    revision is committed to storage (by calling the commit() method on the item
    that holds the revision), thus making it a StoredRevision.
    Item metadata, on the other hand, as infrequently used as it may be, is mutable.
    Hence, it can only be modified under a read lock.
