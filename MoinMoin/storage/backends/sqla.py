    MoinMoin - Backends - SQLAlchemy Backend

    This backend utilizes the power of SQLAlchemy.
    You can use it to store your wiki contents using any database supported by
    SQLAlchemy. This includes SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.

    XXX Note that this backend is not currently ready for use! See the TODOs. XXX


    Talking to the DB
    =================

    In order to communicate with the database, we need to establish a connection
    by requesting a 'session'. `Session` is a class that was bound to the backend object.
    When we create an instance of it, we can persist our objects, modify or delete them.
    (Note that the SA docs suggest keeping the session class in the module scope. That
    does not work for us as we need to to be able to create multiple backend objects,
    each potentially bound to a different database. If the session was global in the module,
    all backends would maintain a connection to the database whose backend was created last.)
    Usually a session is created at the beginning of a request and disposed after the request
    has been processed. This is a bit difficult to realize as we are completely unaware of
    requests on the storage layer.
    Furthermore the backend may be used to store large amounts of data. In order to properly
    deal with such BLOBs, we split them manually into smaller chunks that we can 'stream'
    sequentially from and to the database. (Note that there is no such thing as a file-like
    read(n) API for our DBMSs and we don't want to read a large BLOB into memory all at once).
    It is also very important that we dispose of all sessions that we create properly and in
    a 'timely' manner, because the number of concurrent connections that are allowed for
    a database may be very limited (e.g., 5). A session is properly ended by invoking one of
    the following methods: session.commit(), session.rollback() or session.close().
    As some attributes on our mapped objects are loaded lazily, a the mapped object must
    be bound to a session obviously for the load operation to succeed. In order to accomplish
    that, we currently add the mapped objects to a session and close that session after the object
    has gone out of scope. This is a HACK, because we use __del__, which is very unreliable.
    The proper way to deal with this would be adding revision.close() (and perhaps even item.close?)
    to the storage API and free all resources that were acquired in that method. That of course
    means that we need to adjust all storage-related code and add the close() calls.


    TODO
    ====
    The following is a list of things that need to be done before this backend can be used productively
    (not including beta tests):

        * Data.read must be changed to operate on dynamically loaded chunks. I.e., the data._chunks must
          be set to lazy='dynamic', which will then be a query instead of a collection.
        * Find a proper solution for methods that issue many SQL queries. Especially search_items is
          difficult, as we cannot know what data will be needed in the subsequent processing of the items
          returned, which will result in more queries being issued. Eager loading is only a partial solution.
        * MetaData should definitely NOT simply be stored as a dict in a PickleType Column. Store that properly,
          perhaps in (a) seperate table(s).
        * Find out why RC lists an item that was just written below Trash/ as well. (Likely a UI bug.)
        * Add revision.close() (and perhaps item.close()?) to the storage API and make use of it.
          With the help of __del__, find all places that do not properly close connections. Do NOT rely on
          __del__. Use it only as a last resort to close connections.
        * Perhaps restructure the code. (Move methods that don't have to be on the Item/Revision classes
          into the backend, for example.)
        * Make sure the sketched approach is threadsafe for our purposes. Perhaps use the contextual session
          instead.
        * Currently there only is SQLARevision. Make sure that operations that are not allowed (such as modifying
          the data of an already stored revision) raise the appropriate exceptions.
