    """ return a unique id for a file

        Using just the file's mtime to determine if the file has changed is
        not reliable - if file updates happen faster than the file system's
        mtime granularity, then the modification is not detectable because
        the mtime is still the same.

        This function tries to improve by using not only the mtime, but also
        other metadata values like file size and inode to improve reliability.

        For the calculation of this value, we of course only want to use data
        that we can get rather fast, thus we use file metadata, not file data
        (file content).

        Note: depending on the operating system capabilities and the way the
              file update is done, this function might return the same value
              even if the file has changed. It should be better than just
              using file's mtime though.
              max_staleness tries to avoid the worst for these cases.

        :param filename: file name of the file to look at
        :param max_staleness: if a file is older than that, we may consider
                              it stale and return a different uid - this is a
                              dirty trick to work around changes never being
                              detected. Default is 3600 seconds, use None to
                              disable this trickery. See below for more details.
