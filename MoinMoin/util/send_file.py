"""
A better send_file
------------------

Initially, this was a modified implementation of flask 0.6.0's send_file(),
trying to be as compatible as possible.

For details see: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/issues/issue/104 and the
history of this file in our repository. This code fixes all the issues
described in the bug report.

As we forked send_file, we later modified it (without trying to stay
compatible), because we can easily adapt anyway and the code can be much
simpler without compatibility code.

    """Sends the contents of a file to the client.

    A file can be either a filesystem file or a file-like object (this code
    is careful about not assuming that every file is a filesystem file).

    This will use the most efficient method available, configured and possible
    (for filesystem files some more optimizations may be possible that for
    file-like objects not having a filesystem filename).
    By default it will try to use the WSGI server's file_wrapper support.
    Alternatively you can set the application's :attr:`~Flask.use_x_sendfile`
    attribute to ``True`` to directly emit an `X-Sendfile` header.  This
    however requires support of the underlying webserver for `X-Sendfile`.

    send_file will try to guess some stuff for you if you do not provide them:

    * mimetype (based on filename / attachment_filename)
    * mtime (based on filesystem file's metadata)
    * etag (based on filename, mtime, filesystem file size)

    If you do not provide enough information, send_file might raise a
    TypeError.

    For extra security you probably want to sent certain files as attachment
    (HTML for instance).

    Please never pass filenames to this function from user sources without
    checking them first.  Something like this is usually sufficient to
    avoid security problems::

        if '..' in filename or filename.startswith('/'):
            abort(404)

    :param filename: the filesystem filename of the file to send (relative to
                     the :attr:`~Flask.root_path` if a relative path is
                     specified).
                     If you just have an open filesystem file object f, give
                     `f.name` here.
                     If you don't have a filesystem file nor a filesystem file
                     name, but just a file-like obj, don't use this argument.
    :param file: a file (or file-like) object, you may give it if you either do
                 not have a filesystem filename or if you already have an open
                 file anyway.
    :param mimetype: the mimetype of the file if provided, otherwise
                     auto detection happens based on the filename or
                     attachment_filename.
    :param as_attachment: set to `True` if you want to send this file with
                          a ``Content-Disposition: attachment`` header.
    :param attachment_filename: the filename for the attachment if it
                                differs from the filename argument.
    :param mtime: the modification time of the file if provided, otherwise
                  it will be determined automatically for filesystem files
    :param cache_timeout: the timeout in seconds for the headers.
    :param conditional: set to `True` to enable conditional responses.
    :param add_etags: set to `False` to disable attaching of etags.
    :param etag: you can give an etag here, None means to try to compute the
                 etag from the file's filesystem metadata (the latter of course
                 only works for filesystem files). If you do not give a
                 filename, but you use add_etags, you must explicitely provide
                 the etag as it can't compute it for that case.
