MoinMoin - a wiki engine in Python
==================================

MoinMoin is an easy to use, full-featured and extensible wiki software
package written in Python. It can fulfill a wide range of roles, such as
a personal notes organizer deployed on a laptop or home web server,
a company knowledge base deployed on an intranet, or an Internet server
open to individuals sharing the same interests, goals or projects.


Documentation and Support
=========================

Project homepage is at http://moinmo.in/ - there are also links to support
resources and informations about MoinMoin development status and plans.

In general, please make sure that documentation you read on the wiki or
somewhere else on the web is written for the moin version you are using.

For support, please try the documentation, the homepage, the irc channel
and the mailing list before contacting the MoinMoin authors directly.

If you have trouble with apache (or other webserver) configuration, please
try reading the web server's documentation. Same thing applies for any other
3rd party software usually used with moin, but not written by the MoinMoin
developers.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
