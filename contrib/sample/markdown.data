Markdown Syntax
===============

Features currently not working with moin's Markdown parser are marked with **MDTODO**.

This page introduces you to the most important elements of the Markdown syntax.

For details on the Python implementation of Markdown see <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/>. 

In addition to being supported by moin2, the Markdown markup language is used by issue trackers
such as those found in Bitbucket and Github. So what you learn here can be used to create or 
edit issues on the 
[moin issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/thomaswaldmann/moin-2.0/issues?status=new&status=open).



Table of Contents
-----------------

The table of contents is a supported extension that is distributed with Python Markdown.

**Markup:**

    [TOC]

**Result:**

[TOC]

Headings
--------

Level 1 and 2 headings may be created by underlining with = and - characters, respectively.

Having equal numbers of characters in the heading and the underline
looks best in raw text, but having fewer or more = or - characters also works.

Heading levels 3 through 6 must be defined by prefixing the heading with a variable number of # characters indicating the heading level.  Heading levels 1 and 2 may be defined in the same manner. It is customary, but not required, to follow the # characters with a single space character. Another option is to append the appropriate number of # characters after the heading text.

**Markup:**

    Level 1
    =======
    # Level 1
    Level 2
    -------
    ## Level 2
    --- Levels 1 and 2 are not shown below, see top of page and this section heading.
    ### Level 3
    #### Level 4
    ##### Level 5
    ###### Level 6 ######


**Result:**

### Level 3

#### Level 4

##### Level 5

###### Level 6 ######


Preformatted Code
-----------------

To show a preformatted block of code, indent all the lines by 4 or more spaces.

**Markup:**

    Begin preformatted code

        First line
        Second line
            Third line

    End of preformatted code


**Result:**

Begin preformatted code

    First line
    Second line
        Third line

End of preformatted code

## Simple text editing

**Markup:**

    Paragraphs are separated
    by a blank line.

    To create a line break, end a line  
    with 2 spaces.

    Use asterisk characters to create text attributes: *italic*, **bold**, ***bold italics***. 
    Or, do the same with underscores: _Italics_, __bold__, ___bold italics___.
    Use backticks to create `monospace`.


**Result:**

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

To create a line break, end a line  
with 2 spaces.

Use asterisk characters to create text attributes: *italic*, **bold**, ***bold italics***.   
Or, do the same with underscores: _Italics_, __bold__, ___bold italics___.  
Use backticks to create `monospace`.



## Linking

**Markup:**

    A simple way to write a link: [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in) or [PNG](png)  
    Another way to write a link is to use a reference: [MoinMoin][moin]

    References can be defined anywhere in the document, but it will not be visible in the rendered HTML:
    [moin]: http://moinmo.in

    Naked URLs like http://moinmo.in are not supported. URLs and email addresses may be enclosed in angle brackets: <http://moinmo.in> and <me@example.com>.


**Result:**

A simple way to write a link: [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in) or [PNG](png)  
Another way to write a link is to use a reference: [MoinMoin][moin]

References can be defined anywhere in the document, but it will not be visible in the rendered HTML:
[moin]: http://moinmo.in

Naked URLs like http://moinmo.in are not supported. URLs and email addresses may be enclosed in angle brackets: <http://moinmo.in> and <me@example.com>.


## Lists

Unordered lists may use *, +, or - characters as bullets.  The character used as a bullet does not effect the display.  The display would be the same if * characters were used everywhere.

**Markup:**

    * apples
    * oranges
    * pears
        - carrot
        - beet
            + man
            + woman


**Result:**

* apples
* oranges
* pears
    - carrot
    - beet
        + man
        + woman


Ordered lists use numbers and are incremented in regular order. Neither alpha characters nor roman numerals are supported. Although you may use numbers other than 1 with no adverse effect (as shown below), it is a best practice to always start a list with 1.

**Markup:**

    1. apples
    1. oranges
    7. pears
        1. carrot
        1. beet
            1. man
            1. woman


**Result:**

1. apples
1. oranges
7. pears
    1. carrot
    1. beet
        1. man
        1. woman

Lists composed of long paragraphs are easier to read in raw text if the lines are manually wrapped with **optional** hanging indents. If multiple paragraphs are required, separate the paragraphs with blank lines and indent. 

**Markup:**

    *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
        Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
        viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    *   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
        Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
    *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    *   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.


**Result:**

*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

## Horizontal Rules

To create horizontal rules, use 3 or more -, *, or _ on a line. Neither changing the character nor increasing the number of characters will change the width of the rule.
Putting spaces between the characters also works.

**Markup:**

    ---
    - - - - - -
    ******
    ______


**Result:**

---

- - - - - -

******

______


## Backslash Escapes


Sometimes there is a need to use special characters as literal characters, but Markdown's syntax gets in the way.  Use the backslash character as an escape.

**Markup:**

    *hot*

    333. is a float, 333 is an integer.

    \*hot\*

    333\. is a float, 333 is an integer.


**Result:**

*hot*
 
333. is a float, 333 is an integer.

\*hot\*

333\. is a float, 333 is an integer.


## Nested Blockquotes

Advanced blockquotes with nesting are created by starting a line with a > character.

**Markup:**

    > A standard blockquote is indented
    > > A nested blockquote is indented more
    > > > > You can nest to any depth.


**Result:**

> A standard blockquote is indented
> > A nested blockquote is indented more
> > > > You can nest to any depth.

## Images

Images are similar to links with both an inline and a reference style, but they start with an exclamation point. Within Markdown, there is no syntax to change the default sizes or positions of transclusions:

**Markup:**

    To transclude image from local wiki:
    ![Alt text](png "Optional title")

    Reference-style, where "logo" is a name defined anywhere within this item: 
    ![Alt text][logo]

    Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references and 
    do not appear in the rendered HTML:
    [logo]: png  "Optional title attribute"

    To transclude image from remote site:
    ![remote image](http://static.moinmo.in/logos/moinmoin.png)

    Transcluding a page from a remote site works, but there is no way to change the browser's default size:

    ![Alt text](http://test.moinmo.in/png)

**Result:**

To transclude image from local wiki:
![Alt text](png "Optional title")

Reference-style, where "logo" is a name defined anywhere within this item: 
![Alt text][logo]

Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references and 
do not appear in the rendered HTML:
[logo]: png  "Optional title attribute"

To transclude image from remote site:
![remote image](http://static.moinmo.in/logos/moinmoin.png)

Transcluding a page from a remote site works, but there is no way to change the browser's default size:

![Alt text](http://test.moinmo.in/png)

## Inline HTML

You may embed a subset of HTML tags directly into your markdown documents. 
If there were an official list of allowed tags, it may look like the list below. However, the
Moin implementation of Markdown uses the html_in converter to convert inline HTML: anything
permitted within an HTML item will likely also work within a Markdown item.

    <a>              - hyperlink.
    <b>              - bold, use as last resort <h1>-<h3>, <em>, and <strong> are preferred.
    <blockquote>     - specifies a section that is quoted from another source.
    <code>           - defines a piece of computer code.
    <del>            - delete, used to indicate modifications.
    <dd>             - describes the item in a <dl> description list.
    <dl>             - description list.
    <dt>             - title of an item in a <dl> description list.
    <em>             - emphasized.
    <h1>, <h2>, <h3> - headings.
    <i>              - italic.
    <img>            - specifies an image tag.
    <kbd>            - shows keyboard input.
    <li>             - list item in an ordered list <ol> or an unordered list <ul>.
    <ol>             - ordered list.
    <p>              - paragraph.
    <pre>            - pre-element displayed in a fixed width font and unchanged line breaks.
    <s>              - strikethrough.
    <sup>            - superscript text appears 1/2 character above the baseline used for footnotes and other formatting.
    <sub>            - subscript appears 1/2 character below the baseline.
    <strong>         - defines important text.
    <strike>         - strikethrough is deprecated, use <del> instead.
    <ul>             - unordered list.
    <br>             - line break.
    <hr>             - defines a thematic change in the content, usually via a horizontal line.

**Markup:**

    E = MC<sup>2</sup>
    
    This word is <b>bold</b>.
    
    This word is <em>italic</em>.
    
    This word is <strong>bold</strong>.

    This word is <strong style="color:red;background-color:yellow">bold</strong>; colors depend upon configuration settings.

**Result:**

E = MC<sup>2</sup>

This word is <b>bold</b>.

This word is <em>italic</em>.

This word is <strong>bold</strong>.

This word is <strong style="color:red;background-color:yellow">bold</strong>; colors depend upon configuration settings.

**Note:** See top of [html](html) and configuration docs for information on allow_style_attributes.

### Unsupported HTML Tags

**Markup:**

    Unsupported tags within paragraphs are ignored and create no output.
    <script>alert(1);</script>
    <center>Center</center>
    End of paragraph.

**Result:**

Unsupported tags within paragraphs are ignored and create no output.
<script>alert(1);</script>
<center>Center</center>
End of paragraph.

### Malformed HTML Tags

**Markup:**

    Malformed tags within paragraphs are escaped. 
    <script>alert(1);</script>
    <center>Center</center> 
    <b>
    End of paragraph.

**Result:**

Malformed tags within paragraphs are escaped. 
<script>alert(1);</script>
<center>Center</center> 
<b>
End of paragraph.

## Extensions

In addition to the TOC extension shown near the top of this page, the following features are installed as part of the "extras" extension.


### Tables

All tables must have one heading row. By default table headings are centered and table body cells are aligned left. Use a ":" character on the left, right or both sides of the heading-body separator to change the alignment. Changing the alignment changes both the heading and table body cells. 

As shown in the second table below, use of outside borders and neat alignment of the cells do not effect the display. Markup within the table cells is supported.

**Markup:**

    |Tables            |Are            |Very  |Cool    |
    |------------------|:-------------:|-----:|:-------|
    |col three is      |right-aligned  |$1600 |Necklace|
    |col 2 is          |centered       |$12   |Gloves  |
    |col 4 is          |left-aligned   |$100  |Hat     |

    `Tables`            |*Are*            |Very  |Cool    
    ------------|:-------------:|-----:|:-------
    `col three is`|*right-aligned*|$1600|Necklace
    `col 2 is`|*centered*|$12|Gloves  
    `col 4 is`|*left-aligned*|$100|Hat     


**Result:**

|Tables            |Are            |Very  |Cool    |
|------------------|:-------------:|-----:|:-------|
|col three is      |right-aligned  |$1600 |Necklace|
|col 2 is          |centered       |$12   |Gloves  |
|col 4 is          |left-aligned   |$100  |Hat     |

`Tables`            |*Are*            |Very  |Cool    
------------|:-------------:|-----:|:-------
`col three is`|*right-aligned*|$1600|Necklace
`col 2 is`|*centered*|$12|Gloves  
`col 4 is`|*left-aligned*|$100|Hat   

### Fenced Code

A second way to display a block of preformatted code is to "fence" the code with lines starting with three tilde (~) or backtick (`) characters.

**Markup:**

    ~~~
    <html>
    <body>
    <p>
    Test
    </p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ~~~

**Result:**

~~~
<html>
<body>
<p>
Test
</p>
</body>
</html>
~~~

### Syntax Highlighting of Preformatted Code

To highlight code syntax, wrap the code in triple backtick (`) or tilde (~) characters and specify the language on the first line.  Many languages are supported.

**Markup:**

    ``` javascript
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    ```

    ~~~ {python}
    def hello():
       print "Hello World!"
    ~~~

**Result:**

``` javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

~~~ {python}
def hello():
   print "Hello World!"
~~~

### Smart Strong

The smart strong extension prevents words with embedded double underscores from being converted. e.g.
`double__underscore__words` is wanted, not `double`**underscore**`words`.

**Markup:**

    Text with double__underscore__words.
    
    __Strong__ still works.
    
    __this__works__too__.

**Result:**

Text with double__underscore__words.

__Strong__ still works.

__this__works__too__.



### Attribute Lists

**Markup:**

    A class of green (that will create a green background per a CSS rule) is
    added to this paragraph.
    {: class="green"}

**Result:**

A class of green (that will create a green background per a CSS rule) is
added to this paragraph.
{: class="green"}


### Definition Lists

**Markup:**

    Apple
    :   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
        the family Rosaceae.
    :   An american computer company.
    
    Orange
    :   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

**Result:**

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.
:   An american computer company.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

### Footnotes

The syntax for footnotes in Markdown is rather unique.[^unique] Place any unique label after the characters "[^"  and close the label with a "]". The footnote text may be placed after the reference on a new line using the label, followed by a ":", followed by the footnote text. All footnotes are placed at the bottom of the document under a horizontal rule in the order defined.

[^unique]: Markdown footnotes are unique.

**Markup:**

~~~
Footnotes[^1] have a label[^label] and a definition[^!DEF].

[^1]: This is a footnote
[^label]: A footnote on "label"
[^!DEF]: The footnote for definition
~~~


**Result:**

Footnotes[^1] have a label[^label] and a definition[^!DEF].

[^1]: This is a footnote
[^label]: A footnote on "label"
[^!DEF]: The footnote for definition
