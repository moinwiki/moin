    MoinMoin - WSGI middlewares for profiling

    These have been ported from server_standalone to provide application
    profiling for a WSGI application. They are implemented as WSGI
    middlewares, so they can be plugged right in front of the MoinMoin
    WSGI application. Attention has to be payed, that at the end of
    profiling the `shutdown`-method has to be invoked, so that the
    middlewares can write the reports to the filesystem.

    TODO: in pre-WSGI MoinMoin those profilers where integrated in
          the standalone server and also some other gateway interfaces.
          In the near future the middlewares here could be again made
          configurable automatically with command line switches or
          wiki configuration options.
