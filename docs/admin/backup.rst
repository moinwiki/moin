Backup and Restore
==================

Full Backup / Restore
=====================

The best way to recover from data loss is to have a **full** backup of your machine.
With this backup you can easily restore your machine to a working condition.

The procedure below explains how to selectively backup only the files
essential to your MoinMoin installation. While there is no need to maintain both a full
and a selective backup, having at least one of the two is strongly recommended.

Selective Backup
================
If you want a backup of MoinMoin and your data, then backup the following:

* your data
* moin configuration, e.g. wikiconfig.py
* logging configuration, e.g. logging.conf
* moin script, e.g. moin.wsgi
* web server configuration, e.g. apache virtualhost config
* optional: moin code + dependencies; you should at least know which version you ran, so you can reinstall that version when you need to restore

To create a dump of all data stored in moinmoin (wiki items, user profiles), run the
following command::

 moin save --file backup.moin

Please note that this file contains sensitive data like user profiles, wiki
contents, so store your backups in a safe place that no unauthorized
individual can access.

Selective Restore
=================

To restore all software and configuration files to their original
place, create an empty wiki first::

 moin moin -s -i  # -s = create new storage
                  # -i = create new index

To load the backup file into your empty wiki, run::

 moin load --file backup.moin

Then build an index of the loaded data::

 moin index-build -i
