============
Requirements
============

MoinMoin requires Python 3.8+. A CPython distribution is
recommended because it will likely be the fastest and most stable.
Most developers use a CPython distribution for testing.
Typical linux distributions will either have Python 3.8+ installed by
default or will have a package manager that will install Python 3.8+
as a secondary Python.
Windows users may download CPython distributions from  https://www.python.org/ or
https://www.activestate.com/.

An alternative implementation of Python, PyPy, is available
from https://www.pypy.org/.


Servers
=======

For moin2, you can use any server compatible with WSGI:

* the builtin server (used by the "moin run" command) is recommended for
  desktop wikis, testing, debugging, development, adhoc-wikis, etc.
* apache with mod_wsgi is recommended for bigger/busier wikis.
* other WSGI-compatible servers or middlewares are usable
* For cgi, fastcgi, scgi, ajp, etc., you can use the "flup" middleware:

* IIS with ISAPI-WSGI gateway is also compatible: https://code.google.com/archive/p/isapi-wsgi


.. caution:: When using the built-in server for public wikis (not recommended), use
        "moin run --no-debugger --no-reload" to turn off the werkzeug debugger and auto reloader.
        See the Werkzeug docs for more information.


Dependencies
============

Dependent packages will be automatically downloaded and installed during the
moin2 installation process. For a list of dependencies, see setup.py.


Clients
=======
On the client side, you need:

* a web browser that supports W3C standards HTML 5, CSS 2.1, and JavaScript:

  - any current version of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Maxthon, Internet Explorer (IE9 or newer).
  - use of older Internet Explorer versions is not recommended and not supported.

* a Java browser plugin is required only if you want to use the TWikiDraw or AnyWikiDraw drawing applets.
