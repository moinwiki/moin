Typical development workflow
============================

This is the typical workflow for non-trivial changes and developers that likely
want to contribute more than one change:

* create your own development environment (only once):

  - create a google account (if you don't have one already, it's free), so you
    can use codereview.appspot.com
  - create a bitbucket account (if you don't have one already, it's free)
  - clone ("fork") the main repository on bitbucket, so you have your own bb
    repo to publish your work
  - clone your own bb repo to your local development machine
  - do a development install from your local repo - read the moin2 install docs
    for detailled instructions.
  - join #moin-dev IRC channel and stay there whenever possible

* find some stuff to work on:

  - look at the issue tracker to find some stuff you can solve
  - in case you want to work on some (non-trivial) new issue or idea that is
    not on the issue tracker yet, first create an issue there with a detailled
    description of it
  - discuss with / get feedback from other developers on the #moin-dev IRC
    channel

* work on the stuff:

  - to avoid double work, add a comment on the issue tracker that you are
    working on that issue
  - work in your local repo on your local development machine (make sure you
    work in the right branch)
  - concentrate on one issue / one topic, create a clean set of changes (that
    means not doing more than needed to fix the issue, but also it means fixing
    the issue completely and everywhere)
  - write good, clean, easy-to-understand code.
  - obey PEP-8
  - do not fix or change unrelated stuff while working, but rather create new
    issues on the tracker, so it's not forgotten
  - regularly run the unit tests ("make test"), the amount of failing tests
    shall not increase due to your changes
  - if you fix something that had no test, first try to write a (correct, but
    still failing) test for it, then fix the code and see the test not failing
    any more
  - if you implement new functionality, write tests for it first, then
    implement it
  - do an own review of your changes. Use hg diff, hg status - read everything
    you changed - slowly, looking for stuff that can be improved. Fix
    everything you find that way before requesting feedback from others.
  - get feedback from other developers about your changes:
   
    + put them on codereview (just run python upload.py in your local repo -
      if it is not first upload, reuse the same ID to update the already
      existing codereview)
    + post the codereview URL to #moin-dev IRC channel asking for review
    + if you want to get feedback on non-code stuff, either use the issue
      tracker or a pastebin (only use pastebins for temporary stuff)
  - repeat until everybody is happy with it
  - do some final testing - practically and using the unit tests
  - commit your changes to your local repo, use a meaningful commit comment

* publish your stuff and request it being merged:

  - push the changeset to your public bitbucket repo
  - create a pull request to request that your changes get pulled into the
    main repository
  - optionally, tell about it on the IRC channel
  - if you fixed an issue from the issue tracker, make sure the issue gets
    closed after your fix has been merged.


Alternate contribution workflows
================================
If the above workflow looks like overkill (e.g. for simple changes) or you
can't work with the tools we usually use, you can also do it like this:

* find an existing issue on the issue tracker about the issue you were fixing
  (or create a new one), make sure to give (or update) all the details, like:

  - precise version number / changeset hashes of the original code your patch
    is based on
  - precise description of the issue, how to reproduce it, tracebacks, ...
  - why your fix is correct / how you tested it
* create a patch using the diff tool, attach patch.txt to the issue:

    diff -urN originalcodetree/ modifiedcodetree/ > patch.txt

* if you fixed an issue from the issue tracker, make sure the issue gets
  closed after your fix has been committed to the main repo.

For trivial fixes (like typos), you can also try just grabbing a developer
on IRC, telling filename, line number and get it fixed by him.

Note: if developers find that the required changes are not that simple or are
potentially causing other issues, codereview or other parts of the full
workflow might be needed.


MoinMoin architecture
=====================
moin2 is a WSGI application and uses:

* flask as framework

  - flask-script for command line scripts
  - flask-babel / babel / pytz for i18n/l10n
  - flask-themes for theme switching
  - flask-cache as cache storage abstraction
* werkzeug for low level web/http page serving, debugging, builtin server, etc.
* jinja2 for templating, such as the theme and user interface
* flatland for form data processing
* EmeraldTree for xml and tree processing
* blinker for signalling
* pygments for syntax highlighting
* for stores: filesystem, sqlite3, sqlalchemy, kyoto cabinet/tycoon, mongodb, memory
* jquery javascript lib, a simple jQuery i18n plugin `Plugin <https://github.com/recurser/jquery-i18n>`_
* CKeditor, the GUI editor for (x)html
* TWikiDraw, AnyWikiDraw, svgdraw drawing tools

.. todo::

   add some nice gfx


How MoinMoin works
==================
This is a very high level overview about how moin works. If you would like
to acquire a more in-depth understanding, please read the other docs and code.

WSGI application creation
-------------------------
First, the moin Flask application is created; see `MoinMoin.app.create_app`:

* load the configuration (app.cfg)
* register some modules that handle different parts of the functionality

  - MoinMoin.apps.frontend - most of what a normal user uses
  - MoinMoin.apps.admin - for admins
  - MoinMoin.apps.feed - feeds, e.g. atom
  - MoinMoin.apps.serve - serving some configurable static third party code
* register before/after request handlers
* initialize the cache (app.cache)
* initialize index and storage (app.storage)
* initialize the translation system
* initialize theme support

This app is then given to a WSGI compatible server somehow and will be called
by the server for each request for it.

Request processing
------------------
Let's look at how it shows a wiki item:

* the Flask app receives a GET request for /WikiItem
* Flask's routing rules determine that this request should be served by
  `MoinMoin.apps.frontend.show_item`.
* Flask calls the before request handler of this module, which:

  - sets up the user as flaskg.user - an anonymous user or logged in user
  - initializes dicts/groups as flaskg.dicts, flaskg.groups
  - initializes jinja2 environment - templating
* Flask then calls the handler function `MoinMoin.apps.frontend.show_item`,
  which:

  - creates an in-memory Item

    + by fetching the item of name "WikiItem" from storage
    + it looks at the contenttype of this item, which is stored in the metadata
    + it creates an appropriately typed Item instance, depending on the contenttype
  - calls Item._render_data() to determine what the rendered item looks like
    as HTML
  - renders the `show_item.html` template and returns the rendered item html
  - returns the result to Flask
* Flask calls the after request handler which does some cleanup
* Flask returns an appropriate response to the server

Storage
-------
Moin supports different stores, like storing directly into files /
directories, using key/value stores, using an SQL database etc, see
`MoinMoin.storage.stores`. A store is extremely simple: store a value
for a key and retrieve the value using the key + iteration over keys.

A backend is one layer above. It deals with objects that have metadata and
data, see `MoinMoin.storage.backends`.

Above that, there is miscellaneous functionality in `MoinMoin.storage.middleware` for:

* routing by namespace to some specific backend
* indexing metadata and data + comfortable and fast index-based access,
  selection and search
* protecting items by ACLs (Access Control Lists)

DOM based transformations
-------------------------
How does moin know what the HTML rendering of an item looks like?

Each Item has some contenttype that is stored in the metadata, also called the input contenttype.
We also know what we want as output, also called the output contenttype.

Moin uses converters to transform the input data into the output data in
multiple steps. It also has a registry that knows all converters and their supported
input and output mimetypes / contenttypes.

For example, if the contenttype is `text/x-moin-wiki;charset=utf-8`, it will
find that the input converter handling this is the one defined in
`converter.moinwiki_in`. It then feeds the data of this item into this
converter. The converter parses this input and creates an in-memory `dom tree`
representation from it.

This dom tree is then transformed through multiple dom-to-dom converters for example:

* link processing
* include processing
* smileys
* macros

Finally, the dom-tree will reach the output converter, which will transform it
into the desired output format, such as `text/html`.

This is just one example of a supported transformation. There are quite a few 
converters in `MoinMoin.converter` supporting different input formats,
dom-dom transformations and output formats.

Templates and Themes
--------------------
Moin uses jinja2 as its templating engine and Flask-Themes as a flask extension to
support multiple themes, each theme has static data like css and templates.

When rendering a template, the template is expanded within an environment of
values it can use. In addition to this general environment, parameters can
also be given directly to the render call.

Internationalization in MoinMoin's JS
-------------------------------------
Any string which has to be translated and used in the JavaScript code, has to be defined 
at ``MoinMoin/templates/dictionary.js``. This dictionary is loaded when the page loads and
the translation for any string can be received by passing it as a parameter to the ``_`` function,
also defined in the same file.

For example, if we add the following to ``i18n_dict`` in ``dictionary.js`` ::
    
    "Delete this"  : "{{  _("Delete this") }}",

The translated version of "somestring" can be accessed in the JavaScript code by ::

    var a = _("Delete this");


Testing
=======

We use py.test for automated testing. It is currently automatically installed
into your virtualenv as a dependency.

Running the tests
-----------------
To run the tests, activate your virtual env and invoke py.test from the
toplevel directory::

    make test  # easiest way (all tests, pep8, skipped info)
    py.test --pep8  # run all tests, including pep8 checks
    py.test -rs  # run all tests and outputs information about skipped tests
    py.test -k somekeyword  # run the tests matching somekeyword only
    py.test --pep8 -k pep8  # runs pep8 checks only
    py.test sometests.py  # run the tests contained in sometests.py

Tests output
------------
Most output is quite self-explanatory. The characters mean::

    . test ran OK
    s test was skipped
    E error happened while running the test
    F test failed
    x test was expected to fail (xfail)

If something went wrong, you will also see some traceback and stdout/stderr.

Writing tests
-------------
Writing tests with `py.test` is easy and has little overhead. Just
use the `assert` statements.

For more information, please read: http://pytest.org/

Documentation
=============
Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) and reST markup are used for documenting
moin. Documentation reST source code, example files and some other text files
are located in the `docs/` directory in the source tree.

Creating docs
-------------
Sphinx can create all kinds of documentation formats. The most
popular ones are::

    cd docs
    make html  # create html docs (to browse online or in the filesystem)
