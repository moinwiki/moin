Project Organisation
====================
We mainly use IRC and the wiki for communication, documentation and
planning.

IRC channels (on chat.freenode.net):

* #moin-dev (core development topics)
* #moin (user support, extensions)

Wikis:

* http://moinmo.in/

Documentation:

* http://readthedocs.org/docs/moin-20/en/latest/

Issue tracker:

* http://bitbucket.org/thomaswaldmann/moin-2.0/issues

Code Repositories:

* http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/2.0 (main repository)
* http://bitbucket.org/thomaswaldmann/moin-2.0 (bb mirror for your
  convenience, simplifying forking and contributing)

We use Mercurial DVCS (hg) for distributed version control.

If you are not using Mercurial, you can of course also just send us patches.
In that case, open an issue in the issue tracker and attach the patch there.

Code review:

Please use http://codereview.appspot.com/ for getting feedback on moin-related
code (especially if you want to contribute or publish that code).

If you are using a local mercurial repository/workdir you can very easily
upload your uncommitted workdir state to codereview (using their "upload.py").

Then just ask on the IRC channel for review (give the codereview URL).

MoinMoin architecture
=====================
moin2 is a WSGI application and uses:

* flask as framework

  - flask-script for commandline scripts
  - flask-babel / babel / pytz for i18n/l10n
  - flask-themes for theme switching
  - flask-cache as cache storage abstraction
* werkzeug for lowlevel web/http stuff, debugging, builtin server, etc.
* jinja2 for templating (theme, user interface)
* flatland for form data processing
* EmeraldTree for xml / tree processing
* blinker for signalling
* pygments for syntax highlighting
* for stores: filesystem, sqlite3, sqlalchemy, kyoto cabinet/tycoon, ...
* jquery javascript lib
* CKeditor - GUI editor for (x)html
* TWikiDraw, AnyWikiDraw, svgdraw drawing tools

.. todo::

   add some nice gfx


How MoinMoin works
==================
This is just a very high level overview about how moin works. If you would like
to acquire a more in-depth understanding, try reading more docs and code.

WSGI application creation
-------------------------
First, the moin Flask application is created (see `MoinMoin.app.create_app`) -
this will:

* load the configuration (app.cfg)
* register some modules that handle different parts of the functionality

  - MoinMoin.apps.frontend - most stuff a normal user uses
  - MoinMoin.apps.admin - some stuff for admins
  - MoinMoin.apps.feed - feeds (e.g. atom)
  - MoinMoin.apps.serve - serving some configurable static 3rd party stuff
* register before/after request handlers
* initialize the cache (app.cache)
* initialize index and storage (app.storage)
* initialize the translation system
* initialize theme support

This app is then given to a WSGI compatible server somehow and will be called
by the server for each request for it.

Request processing
------------------
Let's look at how it shows a wiki item:

* the Flask app receives a GET request for /WikiItem
* Flask's routing rules determine that this request should be served by
  `MoinMoin.apps.frontend.show_item`.
* Flask calls the before request handler of this module, which:

  - sets up the user as flaskg.user (anon user or logged in user)
  - initializes dicts/groups as flaskg.dicts, flaskg.groups
  - initializes jinja2 environment (templating)
* Flask then calls the handler function `MoinMoin.apps.frontend.show_item`,
  which

  - creates an in-memory Item

    + by fetching the item of name "WikiItem" from storage
    + it looks at the mimetype of this item (stored in metadata)
    + it creates an appropriately typed Item instance (depending on the mimetype)
  - calls Item._render_data() to determine what the rendered item looks like
    as HTML
  - renders the `show_item.html` template (and gives it the rendered item html)
  - returns the result to Flask
* Flask calls the after request handler which does some cleanup
* Flask returns an appropriate response to the server

Storage
-------
Moin supports different stores (like storing directly into files /
directories, using key/value stores, using an SQL database, etc. - see
`MoinMoin.storage.stores`). A store is extremly simple: just store a value
for a key and retrieve the value using the key + iteration over keys.

A backend is one layer above. It deals with objects that have metadata and
data (see `MoinMoin.storage.backends`) - still very simple stuff.

Above that, there is miscellaneous stuff in `MoinMoin.storage.middleware` for:

* routing by name to some specific backend (like fstab / mount)
* indexing metadata and data + comfortable and fast index-based access,
  selection and search
* protecting stuff by ACLs (access control lists)

DOM based transformations
-------------------------
But how does moin know what the HTML rendering of an item looks like?

Each Item has some mimetype (stored in metadata) - the input mimetype.
We also know what we want as output - the output mimetype.

Moin uses converters to transform the input data into the output data in
multiple steps. It also has a registry that knows all converters and their supported
input and output mimetypes.

For example, if the mimetype is `text/x-moin-wiki`, it will find that the input
converter handling this is the one defined in `converter.moinwiki_in`. It then
feeds the data of this item into this converter. The converter parses this
input and creates an in-memory `dom tree` representation from it.

This dom tree is then transformed through multiple dom-to-dom converters for
e.g.:

* link processing
* include processing
* smileys
* macros

Finally, the dom-tree will reach the output converter, which will transform it
into the desired output format, e.g. `text/html`.

This is just one example of a supported transformation. There are quite a few 
converters in `MoinMoin.converter` supporting different input formats,
dom-dom transformations and output formats.

Templates and Themes
--------------------
Moin uses jinja2 as its templating engine and Flask-Themes as a flask extension to
support multiple themes (each theme has static data like css and templates).

When rendering a template, the template is expanded within an environment of
values it can use. In addition to this (general) environment, parameters can
also be given directly to the render call.

Testing
=======

We use py.test for automated testing (it is currently automatically installed
into your virtualenv as a dependency).

Running the tests
-----------------
To run the tests, activate your virtual env and invoke py.test from the
toplevel directory::

    py.test  # runs all tests
    py.test -rs  # runs all tests and outputs infos about skipped tests
    py.test -k somekeyword  # just run the tests matching somekeyword
    py.test sometests.py  # just run the tests contained in sometests.py

Tests output
------------
Most output is quite self-explanatory. The characters mean::

    . test ran OK
    s test was skipped
    E error happened while running the test
    F test failed
    x test was expected to fail (xfail)

If something went wrong, you'll also see some traceback and stdout/stderr.

Writing tests
-------------
Writing tests with `py.test` is easy and has little overhead. You basically just
use `assert` statements.

For more information, please read http://pytest.org/ - but keep in
mind that we currently still use **py.test 1.3.4**.

Documentation
=============
We use Sphinx (see http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) and reST markup for documenting
moin. Documentation reST source code, example files and some other text files
are located in the `docs/` directory in the source tree.

Creating docs
-------------
Sphinx can create all kinds of documentation formats. The most
popular ones are::

    cd docs
    make html  # create html docs (to browse online or in the filesystem)
