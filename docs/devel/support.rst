You Support MoinMoin
====================

Like to help others?
--------------------
Just stay connected to IRC, our wiki, the mailing list (see above) and help
others searching for support there.

Found a bug?
------------
* File a bug report on the issue tracker (on bitbucket).
* Even better: fix the bug, file a bug report and submit a patch (consider
  adding a unit test)

Having an idea?
---------------
* Discuss it on IRC and file a feature request on the wiki.
* Even better: discuss + write some Python code implementing it.

Born to code?
-------------
* Help working on moin2 core, so it gets finished faster.
* Help maintaining moin 1.9 until moin2 is ready.

No time, but money?
-------------------
* If you use moin in your business and you like some help from a moin
  developer or administrator, consider buying some commercial support (see
  above). It'll save you some of your precious time, likely improve your
  moin experience and help moin administrators and developers to spend more
  time on moin.

Having good language or documentation skills?
---------------------------------------------
* If you are a native speaker of a language other than English, with a good
  understanding of English, consider helping with improving translation to
  your language. **(not yet for moin2, too early!)** see also :doc:`translate`
* Improve the documentation (see below).
