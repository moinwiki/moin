## Sample vhost config file for Apache 2 and MoinMoin
## Add `Include /path/to/this/file` in your Apache httpd.conf activate
## this configuration, and remember to install mod_wsgi and start Apache
## with "-D WSGI"
## For more information on mod_wsgi configuration directives, see
## https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives

## Listen to port 80 on all IPs
## You will probably want to replace * with your server name
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ## Replace with the name of your server (eg. localhost or my.domain.tld)
    ServerName myservername

    ## Note that python-path is required when deploying using virtualenv so
    ## that the interpreter can find the necessary Python packages installed
    ## with MoinMoin. You will probably want to refer to the mod_wsgi reference
    ## documentation for help with this configuration directive, as it includes
    ## too many useful  parameters to list here.

        ## Uncomment the following line for HTTP basic auth
        ## Works with MoinMoin's GivenAuth authentication backend

        ## information on Apache authentication

        ## for username and password
        # AuthName "MoinMoin requires user credentials"
        ## AuthUserFile contains usernames and passwords for wiki users
        ## and can be generated using the htpasswd utility included with
        ## Apache
        # AuthUserFile /home/sam/Programming/MoinMoin/moin-2.0/passwords
        ## valid-user means that the supplied username must be in AuthUserFile
        ## and the supplied password must match the entry for the user in
        ## AuthUserFile
