General
-------

If someone adds a new type of node in the Moinmoin DOM tree:
  
  TODO: add support of new types of node

ReStructuredText
________________

Some syntax of ReStructuredText is ignored because it can't be converted to
the current DOM tree (like inline style/class/template replacement via directives).
Moin needs some page about unsupported things or changes in DOM tree.

Mediawiki
_________

Mediawiki->DOM converter based on moinwiki->DOM parsing model. Moinwiki parser
has blocks (multiline markup) and inline markup, but Mediawiki has tags that are
inline and can be extended to next lines (until closing tag or end of the file).
This creates a problem, for some tags it can be solved by implemented
preprocessor, but it doesn't work with tags that have multiline output
(like <blockquote>).

There are to ways to fix it:

 * preprocessor must input '\n' before <blockquote> and after </blockquote>
 * parser must be able to start new block(multiline) element after inline lexem.
