= WikiDict =

MOINTODO: There is no longer a way to add or view arbitrary metadata. This feature must be reworked. One suggestion is to follow moin 1.9 implementation and add data to item content rather than item metadata.

This item is a WikiDict because it has a "somedict" defined in "extra" metadata:

{{{
{
  "itemid": "932eec2324c3494c9ac8b9dcb2e46359",
  "namespace": "",
  "somedict": {
    "var1": "value1",
    "var2": "value2",
    "var3": "value3"
  }
}
}}}

The above is used by the GetVal macro:

{{{
<<GetVal(help-en/WikiDict, var1)>>
}}}
<<GetVal(help-en/WikiDict, var1)>>
