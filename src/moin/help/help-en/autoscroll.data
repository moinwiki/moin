= Auto Scroll =

When the content type of a target item to be edited is not HTML, double-clicking any line within the rendered text of the item will move to the ''modify'' view and auto-scroll the edit textarea to the line clicked, with limitations.

 * If the user is logged in, then the "Open editor on double click" and "Scroll page after edit" user settings under Options must be checked (the default).
 * If the user has logged in and has changed the "Number rows in edit textarea" user settings under Appearance to a number greater than 0, the textarea will be scrolled to the caret with all modern browsers.
 * If the user is not logged in, or the "Number rows in edit textarea" has the default setting of 0 (meaning the textarea will be vertically sized to hold all content), then the caret will be positioned correctly within the textarea, but the results will differ by browser:
   * Firefox will scroll the window to show the textarea caret near the top of the view area.
   * MS IE11 and Edge will scroll the window to show the textarea caret near the bottom of the window.
   * Chrome, Opera, and Maxthon will not scroll the window; the user may force the window to scroll to the textarea caret by keying the right-arrow on the keyboard.

Because of the way the Markdown parser is constructed, it is frequently not possible to calculate an accurate line number in the text source. This causes auto-scroll to miss the target text. The error can be minimized by consistent use of one blank line between text blocks.
